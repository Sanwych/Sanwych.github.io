2D RPG Style game made in vanilla JavaScript (0 frameworks). 
Started by following a tutorial in youtube, but as I 
was advancing, I noticed some things were not as I 
wanted them so I started customizing it and making it my own game.

Although i'm still working on it, i've already made some huge advancement such as a solid custom movement system.

Shoutout to whoever who made the textures, youre amazing (theyre free for all uses)
